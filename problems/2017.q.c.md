## Problem


N + 2 stalls
the stalls on the left and right ends are permanently occupied
N stalls are for users.

try to choose a stall that is as far from other people as possible. 

For each empty stall S, they compute two values LS and RS, 
    number of empty stalls between S and the closest occupied stall to the left or right
Then they consider the set of stalls with the farthest closest neighbor, that is, 
    those S for which min(LS, RS) is maximal. 


If there is only one such stall, they choose it; 
otherwise, they choose the one among 
    those where max(LS, RS) is maximal. 

If there are still multiple tied stalls, they choose the leftmost stall among those.

K people are about to enter the bathroom; each one will choose their stall before the next arrives. Nobody will ever leave.

When the last person chooses their stall S, what will the values of max(LS, RS) and min(LS, RS) be?
